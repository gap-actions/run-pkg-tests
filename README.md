# run-pkg-tests V2

This GitHub action runs the test-suite of a GAP package.

## Usage

The action `run-pkg-tests` has to be called by the workflow of a GAP

By default it runs the file `tst/testall.g`, gathering coverage while doing so.

Its behaviour can be customized via the inputs below.

### Inputs

All of the following inputs are optional.

- `NO_COVERAGE`:
  - Set to a non-empty string to suppress gathering coverage.
  - default: `''`
- `GAP_TESTFILE`:
  - The name of the GAP file to be read for executing the package tests.
  - default: `'tst/testall.g'`

```yaml

  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  # The CI test job
